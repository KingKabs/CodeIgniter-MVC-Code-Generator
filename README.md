# CodeIgniter-MVC-Code-Generator
This project enables you to automatically generate the Model-View-Controller code files for any database entity you're writing code logic for. It auto-generates boiler-plate code for CRUD operations with respect to Codeigniters MVC architecture and ActiveRecord.
You can really save a lot of time for your projects.
